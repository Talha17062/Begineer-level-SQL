 UPDATE crystal
   SET crystal_name = "diamond"  -- "UPDATE" clause is used to replace the attribute information with the desired one. Lets suppose, if you want to replace the name of the crystal_maker due to the spelling mistake then this query can come in handy. It is to be make sure that "WHERE" clause must be used while using the "UPDATE" clause.
   WHERE crystal_id = "4";      -- In this given query, we changed the crystal_name with "diamond" where crystal_id was 4.
